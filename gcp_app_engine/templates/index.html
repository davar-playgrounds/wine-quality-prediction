                <h4>Did you?</h4>
                <p>Wine is a peculiar beverage. It's handy to know the best practices for serving, handling and storing wine â€“ including choosing the right glasses for your occasion.</p>
 
                <h4>Wine and Food Pairing</h4>
                <p>A great wine and food pairing creates synergy together on your tastebuds. How? Well, the concepts of flavor pairing are moderately complex because they involve hundreds of compounds.</p>
 
                <h4>How grapes are grown</h4>
                <p>The way grapes are grown (viticulture) and how they are subsequently made into wine (vinification) are the two main factors that effect quality in wine.</p>
            </div>
 
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h4>Practices</h4>
                <p>It is very likely that winegrowers have recognized for centuries that specific viticultural practices result in better fruit composition and hence better wines.</p>
 
                <h4>Red Wine</h4>
                <p>Red wine quality and style are highly influenced by the qualitative and quantitative composition of aromatic compounds having various chemical structures and properties and their interaction within different red wine matrices. </p>
 
                <h4>Wine Quality</h4>
                <p>The wine quality was standard, with a slightly high acidity and high sugar content as over-ripened grapes were used. Higher quantities of free sulfur dioxide were expected to help preservation of physicochemical and microbiological quality</p>
